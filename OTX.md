   Click it and it will need a few moment to active it. I think Shuffle will download the container image of that app/tools.
2. Drag and drop the apps and click it untill the configuration field pop up

   In my workflow, I use OTX to enrich Source IP. So I choose Get IPv4 Search.

5. Put your OTX ApiKey there.
